  about: `I'm a software engineer based in St Petersburg, Florida.
   I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.
   I have 6 years of Front-end Development experience in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, tailwind CSS, StyledComponent, React JS and Next JS. Hence,
   I have successfully completed several web projects from scratch. 
   Yet, I learn continuously and never stop exploring new technologies.
   So, I have also gained knowledge of Node JS, Express JS, Mongo DB, Python,
   firebase and React Native with time.
